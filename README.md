# SearchLists
SerachList is the repo for SearchIt which is an electron app that makes it easy to Google a .txt list.

## Note if you plan on Cloning and Packaging
This implementation spawns child processes that are python programs bundled into a pair of single executables for either unix or windows
If you clone and package the app yourself you will need to copy the "/dist" into the "/Resource" folder after the fact (also use icon2.ico when setting your windows icon)

## Simple download links to packaged SearchIt app
Search It is an application I developed to help anyone who finds themselves looking up the contents of a list of things. 

There is a Mac version you can easily install - Just make sure to set your security settings to open apps from anywhere.

The PC version works but it has a custom installer that will make your antivirus very suspicious (as it should be due to the fact that I am pretty much just copying it to your program folder and putting a shortcut on your desktop). So maybe only download the PC version if you are confident you know what you are doing.

## Basic Usage Description
Lets say you have a list of 100 scientific names of flowers. If you save it as a .txt file and open in with Search It then you can work your way though looking up those flowers in Google systematically. You can also add up to six combinations of headers and footers so that instead of looking up 

- "Cuphea ignea"
- "Rudbeckia hirta" 

You could look up...

- "Habitat of Cuphea ignea"
- "Cuphea ignea common name"
- "Habitat of Rudbeckia hirta"
- "Rudbeckia hirta common name"

## Warnings
THIS IS NOT A FINISHED APPLICATION. I am not responsible if Google or any other site you put into the alternate search field thinks you are a robot. Also this is for personal use only. You must get my permission to use this to make money. Feel free to check back for updates though
